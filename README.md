# Simple Smart Contract to Generate Trading Volume on Uniswap V2 Pair using Balancer Flashloan

## This is strictly for Base Network!

This repository contains a simple smart contract that uses a Balancer flashloan to generate trading volume on a Uniswap V2 WETH pair. This project is for demonstration purposes to show how to create trading activity and boost liquidity.

## Overview

The contract takes a flashloan from the Balancer protocol to create a trade on a Uniswap V2 pair. This generates temporary trading volume, which can be useful for liquidity or testing purposes.

**Note**: Do not use on mainnet without understanding the risks.

## Features

- **Balancer Flashloan**: Takes a flashloan from Balancer to start the trades.
- **Uniswap V2 Integration**: Trades tokens on Uniswap V2 to generate volume.
- **Atomic Operations**: Flashloan, trade, and repayment happen in one transaction.

## How It Works

This contract can generate trading volume at a cost that is a fraction of the generated volume. Costs arise from the Uniswap swap fee (0.3% per swap) and any token-specific fees if applicable.

1. The contract takes a flashloan from Balancer.
2. The loaned assets are used to trade on a Uniswap V2 pair.
3. The resulting balance is returned to the flashloan pool in a single transaction.

## How to Use It

1. **Deploy the Contract**: Deploy the contract. Using Remix is the easiest way to do this.
2. **Check Transaction Cost**: Call the function `checkTransactionCost` with the token address and the amount of volume you want to create in ETH (in Wei).
3. **Generate Volume**: Call the function `generateVolume` with the amount of ETH you got from step 2, the borrow amount (the volume amount used in step 2), and your token address.
